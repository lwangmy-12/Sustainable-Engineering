      <abstract>This data release provides computed rainfall (rain total, duration, intensity, erosivity and antecedent rainfall) and flow (flow volume, flow-weighted mean concentrations, total loads, and total yields) metrics from monitored precipitation, discharge, and water quality (nutrients and sediment concentrations) data collected at U.S. Geological Survey edge-of-field (EOF) monitoring sites located in five Great Lakes States (Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and New York). EOF monitoring sites are installed at the edge of agricultural fields, either on the field surface or using subsurface tiles, where runoff can be intercepted and channeled through monitoring equipment before it enters the natural stream system. The methods used to collect this data followed USGS EOF monitoring methods (https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/20081015/). These EOF monitoring sites are located at private farms under a variety of farming systems, landscape settings, drainage areas, soil types, and climates. Site information is provided in the ‘EOF_Site_Table.csv’ data table.

Rainfall metrics were computed for EOF site locations and are provided in the ‘All_EOF_RainEvents.csv’ data table. Rainfall was directly monitored at many, but not every EOF monitoring site. EOF monitoring sites without on-site rainfall data were associated to rainfall data measured at a nearby EOF monitoring site or meteorological site. Rainfall was combined into a single event if it occurred within 2 hours of the previous rainfall. 

Flow data were computed for each flow event at each EOF monitoring site and are available in the ‘All_EOF_StormEventLoadsFormatted.csv’ data table. A flow event was defined as any period of flow at a site that was classified as a storm and represents flow that was related to rainfall or snowmelt. There were occurrences of continuous flow between rain events, which were not associated with a period of rainfall or snowmelt, likely due to excessive soil saturation or shallow groundwater discharge. These periods of intermittent tile discharge were not classified as a storm. 

Multiple precipitation and flow events were combined if they occurred within two hours of each other to account for similar rainfall/runoff characteristics. Rainfall metrics and flow data were then calculated for these combined events at each EOF monitoring site and available in the ‘All_EOF_StormEventLoadsRainCalculated.csv’ data table.</abstract>
      <purpose>Precipitation, discharge, and water quality (nutrients and sediment concentrations) data were collected at U.S. Geological Survey edge-of-field (EOF) monitoring sites located in five Great Lakes States (Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and New York). This data release combines flow totals with sampled sediment and nutrient concentrations to produce flow-weighted concentrations, total loads, and total yields for each distinct flow event. These data support five local, state, and federal cooperative programs (Great Lakes Restoration Initiative – Priority Watersheds, University of Wisconsin Discovery Farms, University of Wisconsin-Platteville Pioneer Farm, Sand County Foundation, and Mississippi River Basin Initiative) with goals of characterizing agricultural influences on water quality and/or documenting water-quality changes attributable to conservation practice implementation. Specifically, edge-of-field monitoring was conducted year-round to evaluate flow characteristics among seasons and variation in weather, field conditions, and agricultural activities.</purpose>

        <procdesc>Site Information:
General site information for Edge-of-field (EOF) and precipitation monitoring sites was provided by the USGS National Water Information System at https://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7P55KJN. Farming practices that take place on the agricultural field for each EOF monitoring site were obtained through conversations with farm operators. Land use data were obtained from the National Land cover Database (Dewitz, 2021). Primary soil type was obtained from the National Resources Conservation Service Soil Survey (NRCS, 2021).</procdesc>
        <procdate>2024</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Field Methods and Data Analysis:
EOF monitoring data including precipitation, discharge, and water-quality (nutrient and sediment concentrations) data were collected and processed using the methods in Stuntebeck and others (2008). Discharge, derived from stage, and water-quality data were collected at each EOF monitoring site, while precipitation data was directly monitored at several EOF sites. Water-quality data were analyzed at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point Water and Environmental Analysis Lab (WEAL). Precipitation and discharge data were analyzed using methods in Stuntebeck and others (2008). All these data are available in the USGS National Water Information System at https://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7P55KJN. Water-quality concentration data were provided at the resolution (i.e., significant digits) reported by the laboratory.</procdesc>
        <procdate>2024</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Flow Metric Calculations:
Flow metrics were calculated for each flow event using discharge and water-quality data collected from at each EOF monitoring site per methods in Stuntebeck and others (2008). 
- Runoff volumes were calculated for each sample collected during an event by summing the time-series discharge values, in cubic feet per second, by the appropriate time period, in seconds, and reported in cubic feet (CF; Stuntebeck and others, 2008).
- Loads were calculated for each runoff event by multiplying the analyte flow-weighted mean concentration in milligrams per liter (mg/L), runoff volume (CF), and two-unit conversions (28.3168 L/CF and 1 pound per 453592 mg) and reported in pounds. If the analyte concentration result value was below the method detection limit (i.e. left censored), half the detection limit was used in the load calculation.
- Estimated loads were calculated for runoff events when samples were not collected to compute an annual load. Event-mean concentrations from the sampled runoff event that most represented the qualities of the unsampled event were used as estimates for unsampled events in the load calculation (Stuntebeck and others 2008). Estimated loads are denoted in the data so they can easily be removed for event-based analysis.
- Yields were calculated for each runoff event by dividing the analyte load by the site catchment (or drainage) area and reported in pounds/acre.</procdesc>
        <procdate>2024</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Rainfall Metric Calculations:
Rainfall metrics were calculated using methods in Wischmeier and Smith (1978 and 1981) and McGregor and others (1995) for each rainfall event using precipitation data collected from sites monitoring precipitation. As previously mentioned in processing step 2, EOF monitoring sites in close proximity shared precipitation data.
- Intensity for each event was calculated by dividing the total amount of rain from the event by the length of time (‘duration’) of the event and reported in inches per hour (in/hr).
- Maximum interval intensity for each event was calculated using 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 minute intervals.
- Rainfall energy for each event was calculated using two methods: 1) McGregor and others (1995) and 2) Wischmeier and Smith (1978 and 1981).
- Rainfall erosivity for each event was calculated using two methods: 1) McGregor and others (1995) and 2) Wischmeier and Smith (1978 and 1981).
- Antecedent rainfall (ARF) for each event was calculated by taking the sum of the total amount of rain for a period of days (not events) before the beginning of the event associated with the flow event and reported in inches.</procdesc>
